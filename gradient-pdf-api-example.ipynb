provided, here's a refined answer to the query:\n","\n","Scaled Dot-Product Attention is a type of attention mechanism used in neural networks, specifically in the Transformer architecture. It is a variation of the dot-product attention mechanism, where the dot product of the query and key vectors is scaled by a scalar value before applying a softmax function to obtain the attention weights. The scaled dot product is computed as:\n","\n","attention_weight = softmax(J \\* dot(q, k))\n","\n","where dot(q, k) is the dot product of the query and key vectors, and J is the scaling factor.\n","\n","In Scaled Dot-Product Attention, the query, key, and value vectors are first linearly transformed using learned linear projections, and then the dot product of the query and key vectors is computed. The use of a scaling factor in Scaled Dot-Product Attention allows the model to selectively focus on different parts of the input sequence, depending on the context. By adjusting the value of J, the model can control the amount of attention it pays to different parts of the input sequence, which can improve the overall performance of the model.\n","\n","In summary, Scaled Dot-Product Attention is a variation of the dot-product attention mechanism that allows the model to selectively focus on different parts of the input sequence, depending on the context, by using a scaling factor to adjust the attention weights.\n","\n","Regarding the compatibility function, it is not explicitly mentioned in the context provided. However, in the original answer, it is mentioned that the compatibility function is used to compute the attention weights. Therefore, the compatibility function is likely a function that computes the dot product of the query and key vectors, which is then scaled by the scaling factor J before applying the softmax function.\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"MrwMOU8AH0Ju"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
